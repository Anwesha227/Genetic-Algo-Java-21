# Genetic-Algo-Java-21

This repository contains Java code for implementing genetic algorithms.
The primary GA method implementations can be found in this [directory](https://github.com/Anwesha227/Genetic-Algo-Java-21/tree/main/src/main/java/geneticChurn/basicmethods)
The summary of different implemented methods is given below.


### Selection Methods : 
 - Tournament Selection
 - Roulette Wheel Selection (with Binary Search)
 - Rank Selection (with Binary Search)
 - Stochastic Universal Sampling
 - Boltzmann Selection
 - Linear Select, but this is only used by Linear Crossover Operator
 
### Crossover Methods :
 - Flat Crossover
 - Simple Crossover
 - Uniform and Non-Uniform Arithmetic Crossover
 - Linear Crossover
 - Blend α crossover
 - Simulated Binary Crossover- SBX
 - Laplace Crossover
 - Discrete Crossover
 - Extended line crossover
 - Wright's heuristic crossover
 - Linear BGA Crossover
 
### Mutation Methods : 
 - Random Mutation
 - Non-uniform Mutation
 - Truncated Gaussian Mutation
 - Muhlenbein's Mutation
 - Mäkinen, Periaux and Toivanen Mutation
 - Power Mutation
 - Polynomial Mutation
 
### Genetic Algorithm Main Constructs
 - Steady State GA
 - Generational GA (with posibility of elitism)
 
Aside from the above, there are Person and Population Implementations. 



Python Scripts were implemented for client server communication (with Java client communicating with Python server) and for some exploratory data analysis.  It is not mandatory to download or even utilize those for the purpose of using the GA methods mentioned above.
